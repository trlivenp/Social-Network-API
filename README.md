## Description
This project I set out to create a social network web application where users could share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create a friends list, I did this by utilizing MongoDB, mongoose, and express. While I coded up the whole project I found myself running into an error I could not figure out. For future production I will be working to fix the errors that populate so that the project can be finalized.

## Usage
To get started the user can begin by running npm install, and then npm start to invoke the application. The server will than be started and mongoose models will be synced to the MongoDB database. To watch how all the routes work I suggest you open up Insomnia and try each route to see how the api functions.
